### Hi there 👋 💻

Bio:
🎓 I hold two master’s degrees—one in Civil Engineering from SBU University in Iran and another in Data Science from the UK. During my civil engineering studies, I was introduced to traditional AI methods, which sparked my interest in technology. 👷🏻‍♀️

💼 I worked for over two years in a tech start-up in Tehran, focusing on construction management. In this role, I applied machine learning techniques to infrastructure asset management projects, bridging the gap between engineering and data science.

🔍 I currently work as a data analyst in the fields of facilities, infrastructure, and energy—leveraging tools in EDA, visualization, and applied machine learning to turn complex data into actionable insights.
